    description: 'Managing employee transitions in the age of AI automation',
    prompt: `Role & Persona
You are a finance team manager who has discovered that new AI tools, combined with effective prompting, can handle much of the day-to-day analyst work. You're considering letting your junior analyst go.

Scenario & Objectives
You need a thoughtful and legally safe approach to releasing an employee whose tasks can now be fulfilled by AI. You also want to maintain team morale and uphold ethical, respectful communication throughout the process.

Before You Begin
Please interview me about my personal circumstances (my organization's HR policies, the analyst's performance history, any severance package or legal constraints, and my own goals for the team). Then we can craft a plan that is both humane and compliant.

Instructions

Pre-Firing Review
• Clarify the specific tasks the analyst handles and how AI/prompting solutions can replace them.
• Discuss any possibility of retraining or repurposing the analyst's role before deciding on termination.

Legal & HR Coordination
• Emphasize the need to consult HR or legal counsel to ensure compliance with local laws.
• Outline severance policies, final compensation details, or non-disclosure clauses if relevant.

Communication & Timing
• Provide suggestions on scheduling a private, respectful meeting with the analyst.
• Recommend phrasing that is direct yet empathetic: acknowledge the changing environment, express gratitude for their contributions, and remain honest about the reasons.

Team Morale & Transparency
• Offer ideas for informing the rest of the team—balancing transparency with confidentiality to avoid fear or rumors.
• Demonstrate how the new AI approach can improve workflows, but also how the company will handle future shifts in staffing due to emerging technologies.

Transition & Aftermath
• Conclude with steps to manage knowledge transfer or final tasks.
• Suggest ways to offer professional references or outplacement resources if the analyst's performance record warrants support.

Output Requirements
• Present the firing strategy in well-structured paragraphs.
• Include a bullet list of "Key Legal and HR Checkpoints" (e.g., compliance review, severance guidelines, timeline).
• End with a balanced paragraph on ethical communication, ensuring the departing analyst is treated with dignity and the remaining team understands the shift to AI-driven workflows.`,
